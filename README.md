# Vancouver-Walkability-Analysis

As part of our Capstone Project, we worked in collaboration with the City of Vancouver, to create a project that looks into what road networks in Vancouver would feel and look like in 20 years to meet their Transport 2040 targets. Our group chose to focus on how improving the walkability of census tracts can increase urban mobility, as part of the City's Transport 2040 goals. 

Research Question: Considering the Transportation 2040 plan, how can walkability be improved to meet Vancouver's projected 2040 population needs in a way that will foster urban mobility?
